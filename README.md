## OpenGL

Reupload of my OpenGL project I used for the presentations I gave on graphics programming. It's a bit messy from the patchwork I've been doing along with the things I purposely leave commented out for presentation purposes. It contains the first part as well so if trying to build it, starting with a single triangle might be a good idea.
All you (hopefully) will have to do is copy the header file of the program you want, paste it into the application file, and build, just as I did when presenting.
  
### The included libs should be **32 bit**

###### I'm mostly new to c++ so if something looks wrong, it probably is ðŸ™ƒ
